## Agenda

### Goals

* **Resolve the NOASSERTION / NONE License Expression Issue:** A long-standing issue that most tools do not follow the spec for, aiming to either resolve it or provide a clear path forward.
* **Clean Up Old Issues:** Address older issues in the repositories, either by closing them or deciding on an implementation plan.

### Tentative Topics

* Adding `NOASSERTION` and `NONE` to license expressions: [\#50](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/50)
* Relationship between licenses: [\#13](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues/13)
* Review and close old licensing issues in the `spdx-spec` repo: [Link to issues](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22profile%3A%20licensing%22%20sort%3Acreated-asc)
* Review and close old licensing issues in the `spdx-3-model` repo: [Link to issues](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-3-model/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AProfile%3ALicensing%20sort%3Acreated-asc)

## Notes & Discussion

### NOASSERTION and NONE in License Expressions

The primary discussion revolved around whether to officially include `NOASSERTION` and `NONE` in license expressions.

* **Rationale for Inclusion:** This would make it easier to combine license expressions, especially in cases where files have different license statuses.
* **Logical Conjunctions:** It was decided that using `NOASSERTION` and `NONE` with the `AND` conjunction makes semantic sense, while an `OR` conjunction does not.
* **Breaking Change:** The group concluded this would not be a breaking change, but rather an **additive change** to the RDF model, targeting **SPDX 3.1**.
* **Tooling Concerns:** Gary raised a concern that some tools already allow `NONE` and `NOASSERTION` in `AND`/`OR` expressions due to complexity. It was suggested that the best practices guide should be updated to clarify appropriate usage.
* **WITH Clause:** It was agreed that using `NONE` or `NOASSERTION` with the `WITH` clause (e.g., `NONE WITH exception`) doesn't make sense and should be disallowed.
* **Next Steps:**
    * **Alexios** will create a PR to update the simple license expression syntax, which will close the related issues.
    * The documentation for **disjunctive license expressions** will be updated to explicitly state that `NONE` and `NOASSERTION` should not be used.

### Relationship Between Licenses

* The discussion focused on how to handle **translations** of licenses.
* **Steward's View:** The consensus was to handle translations within the **License List XML files**. All translated licenses should have a language suffix but share the same common name.
* **Ported vs. Unported:** A reminder was made that ported and unported versions of a license have different license IDs.
* **Next Steps:**
    * The Legal team, led by **Steve**, will review the **EUPL** and propose a solution.
    * The issue will be transferred to the License List XML.
    * A proposed schema change will be made for the License List XML issue.
